# T2TRG 2020-03-20 pre-IETF107 work meeting in Vancouver

We are planning to have a T2TRG work meeting on Friday, March 20th, in
Vancouver before the IETF week.
We are planning to focus this meeting on work that could benefit the
One Data Model liaison group (OneDM).

We could work on providing input that OneDM could use on, e.g.:

* Versioning/evolution of data models, and of the data model language ([SDF][])
* Elements and structure of standardization of the [SDF][] language

[SDF]: https://github.com/one-data-model/language

We are also likely to start and feed activities that are designed to support OneDM,
e.g., continuing the semantic proxy work (W3C WoT, T2TRG) started at
IETF106 hackathon, including:

* Model translation
* The use of model information in:
    * Discovery processes
    * Protocol bindings
    * Semantic APIs

We expect participants to be familiar with the SDF effort and the data
models already being worked on in the [OneDM playground][].

If you have a proposal for a subject, a presentation, or an input
paper on a technical topic, please send email to us now (t2trg-chairs@irtf.org).
