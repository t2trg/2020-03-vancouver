# T2TRG pre-IETF107 work meeting 

**Update:** since IETF 107 f2f was cancelled this will be a fully virtual meeting. 

We are planning to have a T2TRG work meeting on Friday, March 20th, before the IETF week.
We are planning to focus this meeting on work that could benefit the One Data Model liaison group (OneDM).

We could work on providing input that OneDM could use on, e.g.:

* Versioning/evolution of data models, and of the data model language ([SDF][])
* Elements and structure of standardization of the [SDF][] language
* Terminology for data/info/thing models

[SDF]: https://github.com/one-data-model/language

We are also likely to start and feed activities that are designed to support OneDM,
e.g., continuing the semantic proxy work (W3C WoT, T2TRG) started at
IETF106 hackathon, including:

* Model translation
* The use of model information in:
    * Discovery processes
    * Protocol bindings
    * Semantic APIs
* Other technical issues from the [OneDM Github](https://github.com/one-data-model/language/issues)

We expect participants to be familiar with the SDF effort and the data
models already being worked on in the [OneDM playground][].

If you have a proposal for a subject, a presentation, or an input
paper on a technical topic, please send email to us now (t2trg-chairs@irtf.org).
